# Password Manager

This is a password manager with encryption designed to keep your passwords safe and secure. You can use this application to manage your passwords with ease and peace of mind. 

## Features

- Registration process with password strength requirements
- Password vault to securely store passwords 
- View, delete, or edit saved passwords 
- High-security encryption algorithm to encrypt passwords 
- Change master password anytime 
- Easy-to-use and reliable solution 

## How it works

To ensure the security of your passwords, this password manager requires a registration process that ensures the password is strong and meets the necessary requirements, such as a minimum length of 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one symbol.

Once registered, you can add passwords to the password vault. Your passwords are securely stored and protected by a master password. You can view your password vault, check saved passwords, and delete or edit them.

The password manager uses a high-security encryption algorithm that derives the encryption key from the hashed master password and salt. This means that even if someone gains access to your password vault, they won't be able to read the passwords without the master password.

You can change the master password anytime you want. When you do, the password manager re-encrypts all your passwords again with the new master password, ensuring that you keep your account safe and secure.

## About CS50

CS50 is a popular introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University. The course is designed to teach students the fundamentals of computer science and programming, covering topics such as algorithms, data structures, web development, and more.

The course is taught by David J. Malan and his team of educators and is offered online for free through edX. CS50 has become popular for its engaging lectures, challenging problem sets, and supportive online community.

This project was developed as the final project for the CS50 course. The course provided a strong foundation in computer science and programming concepts that were necessary to build this password manager with encryption.
